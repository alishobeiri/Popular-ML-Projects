"[P] I created GPT Pilot - a research project for a dev tool that uses LLMs to write fully working apps from scratch while the developer oversees the implementation - it creates code and tests step by step as a human would, debugs the code, runs commands, and asks for feedback.","https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot
